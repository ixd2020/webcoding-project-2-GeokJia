          When we left our desks back in March, we didn’t think twice about
          leaving our office plants and reading glasses behind. Days became
          weeks, weeks stretched to months. (We eventually said goodbye to the
          fiddle leaf figs). Soon we were sharing tips on how to work together
          while apart, and recognizing a fundamental shift in the way we work.
          The resiliency of our Google colleagues was never in doubt, but this
          year we saw them flex and adapt in exciting new directions, all while
          meeting people where they are (usually at home), to deliver
          experiences that made us feel more connected, informed, and optimistic
          than ever. Most of the work we reviewed for this year’s annual revue
          was created remotely, during a global pandemic, and is shaped by that
          context. And yet, we think you’ll find that the noteworthy
          projects—including crowdsourced earthquake alerts and variable
          fonts—add up to a stellar year for UX at Google. As we look ahead to
          2021 (praise be!) take a minute to applaud the work and the people who
          made 2020 sing.

        <p class="bestintro2">
          This year, the lowly living room doubled as classroom, chem lab, and
          concert hall, but screens were the true MVP—especially for the
          school-age set. AI-powered homework help is just a smartphone snap
          away with the inventive Socratic app, while Kids Space helps little
          ones explore their unique interests via “teacher-approved” books,
          games, and videos (a godsend with after-school programs on pause). If
          music lessons are what you or your kids miss most, enter Shared Piano,
          a web app by Google Creative Lab that’s designed specifically for
          remote teaching and collaboration. Send a link to your instructor and
          start jamming.

          For home-bound gallery-goers, the Google Arts & Culture team will
          bring the museum to you. Thanks to a combination of street view
          mapping and high-res imagery, anyone can take a virtual stroll through
          the world’s top cultural institutions. Want to bop over to Versailles?
          No problemo. Waltz your way through the Palace Museum? Go for it. Or,
          use an AR-assist to step inside a Pocket Gallery created in
          partnership with the National Museum in New Delhi to put 1,000+
          miniature paintings on display. For the readers among us, get lost
          exploring An Ocean of Books, a poetic ML experiment where author
          islands on a fantasy map—trust us, it’s otherworldly—lead to new
          literary connections between the most famous titles in the Google
          Books collection.<br /><br />We applaud the tech that helped small
          businesses go beyond brick and mortar, and kept us close throughout
          2020. Google Food Ordering brought no-contact delivery to doorsteps,
          while Reserve with Google gave 600k+ merchants a way to offer their
          services virtually. For need-to-try-before-you-buy products, Google
          Shopping teamed up with several beauty brands to create an AR app that
          lets you try on (virtual) makeup at home. The team prioritized
          inclusivity and hyperrealism, using extensive research to ensure the
          experience worked for everyone. Nest launched an initiative to help
          seniors stay in touch with family and loved ones, while staying apart.
          Project Merrill gave nearly 1,000 Nest Hub Max devices to quarantined
          residents in seven Washington State retirement communities. Each was
          pre-loaded with contacts for quick video calls to the grandkids, and a
          Google Assistant experience designed especially for less tech-savvy
          folks.

        <p class="besttitle">Tools that make making <br />easier</p>
        <p class="bestintro2">
          We’re biased, but the most versatile tool in the 2020 Google-verse is
          Google Workspace, a new identity and an even more connected experience
          for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Meet, Sheets, and Slides (to name a few).
          “Since we first introduced G Suite back in early 2016, the way we work
          has evolved,” Margaret Cyphers, UX & Creative Director of Google
          Workspace, tells us. “Our work has shifted to be even more connected
          and collaborative.” The transition to WFH gave Cyphers and her team
          increased urgency to ensure that these products not only work together
          seamlessly, but meet people where they are—in new work environments,
          constantly juggling personal and professional responsibilities (who
          has time to open another tab or app anyway?). Think of Google
          Workspace as your productivity multi-tool.

          Tools that empower creators to make more, also top our list. Tone
          Transfer by the Magenta and AIUX team within Google Research creates
          impossible melodies. The more realistic-sounding synthesizer adds
          machine learning to the music-making process, transforming your own
          vocals into an improvisational jazz trumpet or a flute into chirping
          birds. Use Soli Sandbox by Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects
          (ATAP) team to create web-based prototypes that can detect gestures
          (reach, swipe, tap) on the Pixel 4. Need a Soli primer first? Read our
          feature on the emotional intelligence behind this tiny, but powerful
          radar chip. New YouTube features help creators better protect their
          content and demystify ad guidance. Premiere Countdowns build
          anticipation for an upcoming video, by greeting viewers with a custom
          countdown as they tune in for a video debut. Creators can even pick
          from a library of countdowns by some of our favorite artists like Ash
          Thorp, Arina Shabinova, HunterGatherer, and Lucas Zanotto.

          Small gestures towards big change
        </p>
        <p class="bestintro2">
          A look back at 2020 isn’t complete without acknowledging the actions
          many took towards greater, collective change. Continued investment in
          healthier digital habits and new research led to face retouching
          guidelines, and incremental changes to the Pixel phone and Android
          camera app that promote wellbeing. Zooming out, Chromecast
          screensavers served up voting info nationwide, and a project by Google
          Arts & Culture Lab made climate data more engaging. Instead of
          complicated graphs and charts, digital artworks take concepts like
          glacial retreat and make them easier to grok.

          In the midst of a global health crisis, teams across the company
          mobilized: UX writers drafted internal guidance for writing about
          COVID-19, ensuring clear and cohesive messaging: Creative Labs in
          London and New York shipped helpful tools like Sodar, a way to
          visualize social distancing, and Scannable Signs, a QR-code sign
          generator as a contactless way to collect orders, tips, make
          appointments, or leave reviews; Assistant teamed up Google Health to
          launch self-screening for COVID-19 symptoms, and then with Search and
          Maps to help local businesses share what health and safety measures
          they have in place; Google.org Fellows collaborated across seven
          different time zones on Global.health to share public health data with
          institutions.<br /><br />

          Teams also worked toward more equity and inclusion in our products.
          Google Kids Space launched with over 1,000 unique avatar
          assets—featuring everything from vitiligo to face masks—kids can mix
          and match to reflect their current or future selves. Gender equity
          work yielded Safe Folder, a way for anyone to safeguard files on a
          shared Android device, while Chrome released better password
          protection and more intuitive privacy settings (like bumping the
          beloved ‘clear browsing data’ button to the top, and a new tool to
          tell you when your saved passwords have been compromised and how to
          fix them)—steps towards a safer internet for everyone. Lookout app
          from the Central Accessibility team got a redesign, including new ways
          to scan entire pages and food products without a barcode.

          Soft tech that leaves us feeling <br />fuzzy inside

        <p class="bestintro2">
          Did someone say cozy season? This year we got reaaaaal close with our
          devices. As our collective screen time skyrocketed, Google hardware
          designers pulled the nature-inspired swipe for this year’s launches,
          which Google Seed Studio reflected in a series of videos and visuals
          that highlight the inspiration behind these products. “In times when
          life can feel so hectic, we want our devices to visually and tactilely
          reflect a moment of calm,” says Lead Industrial Designer Linda Jiang.
          On the same wavelength, Head of Human Centered Innovation & Strategy
          Hector Ouilhet advocated for more warmth in human computing in a
          recent op-ed: “If designed right, ambient computing can subtly enhance
          people’s relationships with other people and the natural world around
          them, just as ambient lighting makes a living room feel warmer and
          ambient music makes a conversation flow smoother.”

          Designers and technologists can envision more resilient futures by
          looking to the natural world. At least that’s the provocation put
          forth by Google AI’s Strategy & Research team in a fascinating piece
          we featured on Google Design this past summer. The writers posit that
          natural qualities like distributed, diverse, and mutual—offer us a
          playbook for building systems that can adapt and thrive, regardless of
          changing environments. (Something we could all use to help us through
          2020). To see just what they mean, look no further than a few of our
          favorite future-ready projects.

          Android’s ingenious Earthquake Alert System relies on a distributed
          network—each Android phone acts as a mini seismometer—to form the
          world’s largest earthquake detection network. The Google Flood
          Forecasting Initiative expanded the reach of its service to all of
          India, and improved the quality of alerts by partnering with several
          like-minded organizations to keep people safe and informed. A redesign
          of Google Maps, reveals more of the earth’s details by streamlining a
          palette of 700+ colors down to 25—while creating a stronger foundation
          for future updates and making the Map more accessible.
          <br /><br />This year, Google Fonts turned ten in style with the
          launch of a shiny new site, and support for variable fonts. The nifty
          type technology allows fonts to flex based on various axes, like
          width, slant, and thickness. Fraunces by Undercase Type is one such
          example. This “Old Style” but not Old Style (wink, wink) serif was
          inspired by early 20th century display typefaces such as Windsor,
          Souvenir, and Cooper Black. The font’s lovely microsite lets you dial
          in the ‘wonk’ axis to your liking, and it’s beautiful to boot. If a
          low-contrast, humanist sans-serif is more your speed, check out
          Commissioner, another worthwhile addition to the GF catalog. And if
          it’s feelings you’d rather flex, may we gently recommend Emoji
          Kitchen. Built by the Android Expressions team, this well-timed
          release allows you to express every emotional intersection by mashing
          up two emoji to create anything from kissy cowboy to fiery trash can.
          It is 2020, after all.<br /><br /><i
